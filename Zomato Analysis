🍽️ Zomato Sales Performance Analysis

📋 Project Description
This project presents an in-depth sales analysis using historical Zomato platform data, visualized through an interactive Tableau dashboard. 
The core objective was to uncover sales performance patterns, identify top-selling restaurants and menu items, and provide actionable business recommendations to enhance profitability and customer engagement.

🧠 Why This Project?
Food delivery platforms like Zomato thrive on high-volume, data-rich environments. Yet, without proper analysis, strategic blind spots can hinder growth. This project was created to:

Understand which restaurants and items drive the most revenue

Analyze temporal sales patterns to inform marketing campaigns

Highlight consumer behavior trends that shape platform strategy

Offer recommendations to support decision-making and retention initiatives

⚙️ Features & Focus Areas
The Tableau dashboard includes six core modules:

🏪 Sales by Restaurant – Ranking of revenue-generating restaurants

🍲 Most Ordered Items – Insights into customer food preferences

📅 Sales by Day of the Week – Temporal patterns in ordering habits

🕐 Hourly Sales Trends – Peak order times and customer activity windows

📈 Total Sales Over Time – Business performance trend analysis

💰 Average Order Value – Revenue efficiency per transaction

🧠 Key Findings & Insights
🏆 Top Restaurants
Jayhind Sweets led with ₹134 billion in total sales.

Krishna Food, Huber & Holly, and WoW China followed closely.

These brands exhibit strong loyalty, operational efficiency, and consistent customer demand.

Recommendation: Deepen partnerships, analyze their pricing/menu structures, and apply best practices across lower-performing vendors.

🍚 Most Ordered Items
Jeera Rice topped the list with 84,000+ orders, followed by Vegetable Fried Rice, Paneer Butter Masala, and French Fries.

Predominance of vegetarian, rice-based dishes reflects regional preference for comfort and affordability.

Recommendation: Promote popular dishes through combo offers, loyalty perks, and highlighted placement in menus.

📅 Day-of-Week Sales Trends
Friday unsurprisingly led with ₹570B+ in sales.

Tuesday came second—beating both Saturday and Sunday.

Recommendation: Launch Tuesday-specific promotions, validate corporate/work-from-home ordering patterns, and avoid over-prioritizing weekends.

🕐 Time-Based Sales Behavior
Peak order hours centered around lunch and dinner times, informing optimal ad/promo scheduling.

📉 Sales Over Time & AOV
January 2018 showed a significant sales spike followed by a sustained decline.

Average Order Value also mirrored this downward trend.

Recommendation: Investigate customer churn, market saturation, and promotional effectiveness during the 2018 peak; relaunch seasonal or loyalty campaigns based on past success patterns.
